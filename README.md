# Shipping Time Calculator


This project helps the users calculate the estimated shipping date based on three different inputs: Order Date, Fabric Type, and Quantity.  

Through the controls placed on input fields, it limits the values in the input fields: Order date cannot be a past date; fabric type can either be Cotton or Linen; and quantity can only be a value between 1 and 100. 

Warning texts are used to help user enter the expected values. A modal is used to warn the user if any one input field has an incorrect value. A tooltip is placed to give info about the quantity. 

It is a responsive website utilizing TailwindCSS to style elements.
